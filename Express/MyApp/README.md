# Express MyApp Sample

This sample was created using the Express command line executable.

To create your own version, install express globally using:

```
npm install -g express
```

Then, in a working directory, execute:

```
express express --sessions -css stylus MyApp
```

This command:
- Creates a MyApp directory
- Creates the initial files and folders
- The new application will use sessions
- Uses stylus stylesheet support (alternative: less; if none is specified, plain css is used)
